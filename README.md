Salary Navigator is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline the management of employee salary data and related HR functions. It provides a secure and user-friendly platform that separates access for administrators and employees, enabling efficient handling of salary approvals, attendance tracking, leave management, and salary deductions.

The application ensures that only authorized employees can create profiles after admin approval and secret code verification, maintaining high data security standards. Employees have access to detailed views of their attendance records, leave statuses, and salary deductions, promoting transparency and self-service.

Meanwhile, administrators have full control over the employee lifecycle â€” from approving new registrations and managing leave requests to monitoring overall employee activity and salary-related data. Built using modern technologies like Java, Spring Boot, React, and SQL, Salary Navigator offers a robust, scalable solution suitable for organizational payroll and HR needs.
